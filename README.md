# stock-tracker
- Tracks stock market changes for desired NASDAQ companies
- Currently tracks within the same day and displays a graph through Canvas API in Vanilla JavaScript
- Backend server is hosted through Heroku via Python programming language


## Additional Ideas In Progress
- Login through Database for Favorites / Followed Stocks
- Edit Recent-Searches once Database is set up
- Edit graphs layout (Matplotlib -- Python library)
- Figure something out for organizing recently reviews stocks.. (comprehensive data or merely a list ??)
    - Main page already works as a comprehensive graph version.. Perhaps the Recents have links to specific Daily, Weekly, Monthly

### Reasons for this
- To develop something I find useful and more adapative to the real world
- To practice new coding skills through Python
- To further my understanding of backend coding
- To learn some new libraries
- To leave JavaScript behind as my most proficient programming language
